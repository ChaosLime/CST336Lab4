        <p class="text-primary">Earth is the only planet whose English name does not derive
        from Greek/Roman mythology. The name derives from Old English and 
        Germanic. There are, of course, hundreds of other names for the
        planet in other languages. In Roman Mythology, the goddess of 
        the Earth was Tellus – the fertile soil 
        (Greek: Gaia, terra mater – Mother Earth).</p>
