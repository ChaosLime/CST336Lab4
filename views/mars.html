        <p class="text-primary">Mars has been known since prehistoric times. Of course, it has been 
        extensively studied with ground-based observatories. But even very large
        telescopes find Mars a difficult target, it’s just too small.
        It is still a favorite of science fiction writers as the most 
        favorable place in the Solar System (other than Earth!) for human habitation.
        But the famous “canals” “seen” by Lowell and others were, unfortunately,
        just as imaginary as Barsoomian princesses.</p>
