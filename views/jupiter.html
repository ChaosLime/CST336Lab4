        <p class="text-primary">Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus).
        It has been known since prehistoric times as a bright “wandering star”.
        But in 1610 when Galileo first pointed a telescope at the sky he discovered
        Jupiter’s four large moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto (now known as the Galilean moons)
        and recorded their motions back and forth around Jupiter. This was the first discovery of a 
        center of motion not apparently centered on the Earth. It was a major point in favor of Copernicus’s 
        heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets (along with other new
        evidence from his telescope: the phases of Venus and the mountains on the Moon). 
        Galileo’s outspoken support of the Copernican theory got him in trouble with the Inquisition.
        Today anyone can repeat Galileo’s observations (without fear of retribution
        using binoculars or an inexpensive telescope.</p>
