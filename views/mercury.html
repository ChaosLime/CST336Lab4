        <p id="planetInfo">Mercury has been known since at least the time of the Sumerians 
        (3rd millennium BC). It was sometimes given separate names
        for its apparitions as a morning star and as an evening star. 
        Greek astronomers knew, however, that the two names referred to
        the same body. Heraclitus even believed that Mercury and Venus 
        orbit the Sun, not the Earth.</p>
